Example Project
===============
Import this example project in to Studio to run through the various examples of Core.

We made it easy to run these all in one Ti project.  Open `/app/config.json`
and change the name of the `"examples"` property to the example you want to run.

e.g. Change the name to "simple" to run the simple sample app.
